  ## Description
  <a name= 'description'></a>
  Jolt is a personal finance tracker that lets you track your account balance, set goals, allocate funds and see recent transactions. The dashboard shows a line chart of your account balance for the past 30 days, 3 months, 6 months or year. On the goals page, when creating a goal, there is a progression bar to show how close to your goal you are. On the budget page, creating a bucket will update the chart to, visually, show you where and what you money is for. The expenses page will show recent spending

  ## Installation
  <a name= 'installation'></a>
  To install, Jolt clone the repo and run "npm run install" in the root terminal.

  ## Usage
  <a name= 'usage'></a>
  To use Jolt, first you need to create an account. Upon creating an account you will be signed in. You, then, need to link you bank account to you Jolt account. When that is complete, the dashboard page will have a line chart of your account balance with four different time interval options. It displays your past 1 month, which is the past 30 days. Clicking the "3 Month", "6 Month" or "1 Year" button will display the high for the month depending on which interval is selected. On the goals page, you have you account balance, and can create goals to save for by typing in a goal name, how much money you can set aside for it and how much you will need for your goal. Pushing the save button will add your goal to the "My Goals" section of the page. When you have more money to add for your goal, you can click the "Add Funds" button and add however much you are able to. You can also remove the goal by pressing the "Remove" button. On the budgeting page, there is a doughnut chart where you can allocate funds into buckets by pressing the "Add Bucket" button. You can delete any bucket you have created by pressing the "Delete" button. The expenses page shows your recent purchases.
